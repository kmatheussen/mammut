-Play: Fix changing play position in realtime not always working.
-GUI: Fix printing Ø in the about box.
-GUI: Turn off startup sound by default.
-GUI: Save prefs immediately, not when exiting program.
-GUI: Make main window resizable.
-DSP: Avoid denormals. (Just in case. Don't know if it was a problem).
-Build: Build with -mfpmath=sse -msse2 -Wextra -Werror -Wall, and fix various potential bugs found by newer compilers and -Wextra.
-GUI: Set moving camera to true by default
-Build: Fix install instructions
-Build: Upgraded Juce to 5.3.2
-Build: Varoius build fixes from GeorgeNs.


0.59 -> 0.60
-Updated source to work with Juce 1.44.
-Fixed a couple of ugly bugs in the progress bar code.
-Set moving camera to be off by default. Moving camera seems to stall mammut using newer juce's. :-(


0.58 -> 0.59
-Fixed a couple of more int->uint32 time variable cases. Hopefully, the animation
 stuff shouldn't stall the machine anymore.


0.57 -> 0.58
-Added workaround for rare sound corruption bug.
-Added the "Redo it!" buttons. (The same as pressing "Undo" + "Do it!")
-If playing while pressing a "Do it!" or "Redo it!" button, continue playing after
 processing as well.
-Added the "Random Phases" toggle button in the "Multiply Phase" dialog. Checking
 this button will freeze the sound. Thanks to Tim Blechman for the idea.
-Fixed looping which wasn't turned off if using a different sampling rate.
-Added "make install" and "make uninstall"
-Fixed animation bug. (should allways be shown now)


0.22 -> 0.57
-Ported from gtk1 to juce.
-Various bells and whistles
-Binaries for windows and mac
-Various other things

0.21 -> 0.22
-Added patch and instructions from Owen Green on how to make mammut compile on
 OSX. Thanks!

0.20 -> 0.21
-Set realtime priority for the player thread to ensure clickless playing.
-Fixed some trouble when exiting.

0.19 -> 0.20
-Fixed a bug in the Makefile caused by a fix in the previous release.

0.18 -> 0.19
-Fixed some bugs in the Makefile.

0.17 -> 0.18
-Fixed a (horrible) bug that caused mammut to crash on newer linux
 distributions.
-Simplified the install process a lot. pygtk1, libglade and sndlib
 is now included in the distribution and is/can be installed
 automatically if needed.
-Added undo for load&multiply

0.16 -> 0.17
-Removed the sndlib binary.
-Initialize sound at startup, so that mammut appears in jack patch bays.
-Added a point in the INSTALL file about how to configure mammut to
 find the pygtk1 files.
-Added a note in the INSTALL file about that sndlib for some reason
 does not work with delta cards when using the alsa driver. The oss
 driver (under alsa emulation), and the jack driver works just fine.


0.15 -> 0.16
-Tiny source cleanup.
-Upgraded the included sndlib binary for i386 to latest version. This
 one includes jack-support.


New in V0.14 -> 0.15
-Removed the synth transform. It was not supposed to be there and had no
 function.
-Fixed the wobble transform. Segfaulted with mono-files. (Bug found
 by Dave Phillips)


New in V0.13 -> 0.14
-Fixed the rest of the transforms to support more than two soundchannels.
-Removed the settings->undo menu item, which didnt have any function.
-Updated the version number in the about dialog from 0.12 to 0.14
-Wrote unlimited number of channels instead of four(?) channels in the
 usage message.
-Neither the Cancel nor OK button in the "Amplitude->Phase" transform dialog
 did work. Fixed.
-Removed lots of debug printings.
-Playing without having a file caused a segfault. (fixed)


New in V0.12 -> 0.13
-Updated the version number in the about dialog from 0.10 to 0.12
-Neither the Cancel nor OK button in the "Split real/imag" transform dialog
 did work. Fixed.
-Unneded references to libaudiofile headers removed. libaudiofile is not
 used in mammut.
-libsnd linking was screwed up in the Makefile in the V0.12 release. Fixed
-Playing without having a file caused a segfault. (not fixed)
-Added sndlib.a and sndlib.h to the distribution. Static oss/linux compiled.
 (sndlib.a seems to be a bit troublesome to compile up sometimes.) (same as
  in ceres)
-Added note about a common problem regarding pygtk in the INSTALL file
 that usually makes ceres crash. (same as in ceres)
-Most of the transforms didnt support more than two channels (stereo).
 Now most of the transforms do, but still not all.


New in V0.11 -> 0.12
-The "Number of partials" slider in the Synth transform dialog did
 not work and gave a lot of errors. Fixed.
-Neither the Cancel nor OK button in the "Keep the peaks" transform dialog
 did work. Fixed.


New in V0.10 -> 0.11
-Added compile-option for where to place temporary files.
 Undo/redo probably did not work in V0.10 unless you had
 a directory named /lyd/local/tmp. Oops.
-Fixed a mysterious bug that caused loading of files look
 strange and the sound to be played automaticly.
-Added support for libsndfile V1. (V0 is still supported too.)


New in V0.08 -> 0.10

-Using gtk instead of motif. The reason is cleaner code
 because of better python-support, and more portable.
-Buttons in the main-window.
-Support for 16,24 and 32 bits soundfiles, not only 16 bits.
-Support for float and double soundfiles.
-Fixed filenamebugs in combsplit and reimsplit
-Replaced libaudiofile with libsndfile.
-Removed soundfile length limitation.
-Removed some warnings.
-Playing internally from program using sndlib.
-Added undo/redo. (currently hardcoded to 300000 levels)
